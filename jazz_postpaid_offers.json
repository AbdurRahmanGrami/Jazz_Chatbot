These tariffs are irrespective of the roaming operator used in these countries. So, be worry-free when you are in Zone 1 !\nZone 2 has countries with slightly higher tariffs. Please double-check tariff there.\nInflight and maritime roaming are expensive and not covered in this offer.\nIf you face issue using data roaming in any country. Check you APN settings. Make sure your APN is set as ‘Jazz’.\nCalls are billed in minute increments.\nAll calls made to numbers listed in visited country are treated as Local calls.\nAll calls made outside the visited country, except calls back to Pakistan, are treated as International calls or Rest of World (ROW) calls.\nCalls made and received on roaming will not include any free minutes that may apply to Tariff Plan.\nWhile on roaming, for call back to Pakistan, please dial +92 before the number.\nAll tariffs are charged in Pak Rupees when billed.

    "FullText": "Postpaid   Roaming Tips - Jazz\nHome\npostpaid\nroaming tips\nInternational\nRoaming Tips\nEducate yourself and enjoy roaming\nOVERVIEW\nSome useful information for our users on the move…\nTips for Roamers\nThings to remember on roaming:\nJazz Roaming has never been more simple and affordable. Just a few tips:\nJazz Self-Service channels:\nJazz\nWorld application, WhatsApp self-service support are some of our self-service channels. View the following links:\nJazz Self Service Channels\nJazz World Application\nWhatsApp Self-Service\nWhat if your roaming is not working:\nLets say your roaming was working fine until recently and now it isn’t. Or you got it activated but it isn’t working. Don’t worry. Simply restart your handset, go to settings , find manual operator selection and select any operator from the list available. It should work. If still unsuccessful, email us at\ncustomercare@jazz.com.pk\n. Corporate customers can contact their JBC. We shall take care of it.\nKnow your tariff:\nWe have just made roaming easy for all with $0.2 per min or mb in over 70 major countries. Over 90% of Jazz roamers visit these countries. Still, just make sure you know the roaming rates for the country you plan to visit.\nSay Yes to Data Roaming:\nSince data roaming is also $0.2 per mb in over 70 countries which is much affordable now. We encourage you to use data roaming. Roughly you can make 2-3 minutes of WhatsApp audio call in 1 mb. Not bad, right !\nWhat if Data Roaming is not working\n:\nIf your data roaming is active and you still face issues using it abroad just check:\nYour APN (Access Point Names) settings. Simply configure APN to ‘Jazz’\nSwitch on Data Roaming & Mobile Data from handset settings\nWe shall text you:\nWhile on roaming, you will continue to receive free welcome sms and data usage alerts to help you know your tariff, available offers and avoid any bill shock.\nWatch out for Inflight & maritime:\nNon-terrestrial roaming is expensive. Just make sure your mobile is put on Airplane mode here.\nNo Background Apps:\nSometimes, apps continue running in background without you knowing. So, its better to either turn data roaming on when using it or simply block apps from using data in background (check your mobile data settings).\nSwitch off all free services that you subscribe to. Certain data based applications viz. GPS, Facebook, Twitter, Widgets, RSS Feeds, Email, weather updates, News, Blackberry Messenger or any other instant messaging application etc. as they continuously consume data bandwidth leading to high Data-Roaming charges even when you are not using the same.\nWhy Call forwarding:\nCheck status of your call forwarding to ensure you cancel all call forwards before you travel abroad. So, you may want to review/cancel any call diverts that you may have activated as there will be two-way Roaming charging on Voicemail services and on conditional call forwarding while roaming.\nHow to Activate Now:\nNow that you have gone through these tips, we say it’s a good idea to use roaming and not purchase a local sim from abroad. For postpaid, we have reduced the credit limit requirement for roaming activation which is now Rs. 5000 for postpaid individual customers and Rs. 10,000 for corporate customers. Postpaid individual customers can visit any nearest Jazz business centre, call 777 or email to\ncustomercare@jazz.com.pk\nfor roaming activation. Corporate customers simply need to advise their JBCs (Jazz Business Consultants).\nList of International Direct Dialing Codes\nSr. No\nCountry\nCodes\n1\nAfghanistan\n93\n2\nAlbania\n355\n3\nAlgeria\n213\n4\nAmerican Samoa\n684\n5\nAndorra\n376\n6\nAngola\n244\n7\nAnguilla\n1264\n8\nAntarctica (Casey)\n67212\n9\nAntarctica (Scott & Ross Island)\n67224\n10\nAntigua (Barbuda)\n809\n11\nArab Republic of Egypt\n20\n12\nArgentina\n54\n13\nArmenia\n374\n14\nAruba\n297\n15\nAscension Island\n247\n16\nAustralia\n61\n17\nAustria\n43\n18\nAzerbaijan\n994\n19\nBahamas\n18093\n20\nBahrain\n973\n21\nBangladesh\n880\n22\nBarbados\n1246\n23\nBelarus\n375\n24\nBelgium\n32\n25\nBelize\n501\n26\nBenin\n229\n27\nBermuda\n18092\n28\nBhutan\n975\n29\nBolivia\n591\n30\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n387\n31\nBotswana\n267\n32\nBrazil\n55\n33\nBritish Virgin Islands\n1284\n34\nBrunei\n673\n35\nBulgaria\n359\n36\nBurkina Faso\n226\n37\nBurundi\n257\n38\nCambodia\n855\n39\nCameroon\n237\n40\nCanada\n1\n41\nCape Verde Islands\n238\n42\nCayman Islands\n1345\n43\nCentral African Republic\n236\n44\nChad\n235\n45\nChile\n56\n46\nChristmas & Cocoas Islands\n6724\n47\nColombia\n57\n48\nComoros\n269\n49\nCongo\n242\n50\nCook Islands\n682\n51\nCosta Rica\n506\n52\nCroatia\n385\n53\nCuba\n53\n54\nCyprus\n357\n55\nCzech Republic\n420\n56\nDem Rep of Madagascar\n261\n57\nDem.
