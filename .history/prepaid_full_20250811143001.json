These tariffs are irrespective of the roaming operator used in these countries. So, be worry-free when you are in Zone 1 !\nZone 2 has countries with slightly higher tariffs. Please double-check tariff there.\nInflight and maritime roaming are expensive and not covered in this offer.\nIf you face issue using data roaming in any country. Check you APN settings. Make sure your APN is set as ‘Jazz’.\nCalls are billed in minute increments.\nAll calls made to numbers listed in visited country are treated as Local calls.\nAll calls made outside the visited country, except calls back to Pakistan, are treated as International calls or Rest of World (ROW) calls.\nCalls made and received on roaming will not include any free minutes that may apply to Tariff Plan.\nWhile on roaming, for call back to Pakistan, please dial +92 before the number.\nAll tariffs are charged in Pak Rupees when billed. US dollar to Pak rupee exchange rate applied for each calendar month is open market exchange rate on 23rd day of the preceding month.\nTariffs are calculated using prevailing exchange rates and subject to change without prior notice.\nFax facility will not work while on roaming.\nWhile abroad, customers can contact Jazz's International Roaming Helpline on +923008470112 / +923002000100. \"Call to Pak\" rates apply.\nGovernment taxes apply.\nCalls to Satellite, Premium rate, Toll-free numbers and Emergency numbers are charged at higher rates as charged by foreign operators (Approx. $10/min).\nRoaming user can have a track on his / her Roaming usage by dialing *2222#.\nIf you have opted for Roaming data bundles, please note that upon expiry or consumption of bundle, customer will be charged on standard PAY as you Go tariff.\nPlease note that there can be delays in reporting of roaming events from the destination operator and it will be billed upon receiving.\nOUTGOING Call Charges\nSMS Charges per message\nCOUNTRY\nNETWORK OPERATOR\nNETWORK CODE\nINCOMING Call Charges (PKR)\nLocal (PKR)\nCall back to Pakistan (PKR)\nROW\nSatellite\nIncoming\nOutgoing\nLOCAL HELPLINE (from mobile)\nINTERNATIONAL HELPLINE\nAlbania\nVodafone - Albania\n355-69\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nAlgeria\nOptimum Telecom Algeria Spa\n213-770\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nArmenia\nTelecom Armenia\n374-91\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nAustralia\nVodafone TGP Telecom Limited\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nAustralia\nSingTel Optus Pty Limited\n61 411\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nAustralia\nSingTel Optus Pty Limited\n505/02\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nAustria\nHutchison Drei Austria GmbH\n232/05\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1500\nFree\n25\nAzerbaijan\nBakcell Limited Liable Company\n400/02\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBahrain\nZain Bahrain B.S.C\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1500\nFree\n25\nBahrain\nSTC Bahrain\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1500\nFree\n25\nBangladesh\nGrameenphone Ltd\n880-17\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBangladesh\nBanglalink Digital Communications Ltd.\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBelgium\nORANGE Belgium nv/SA\n32-495\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBelgium\nProximus PLC\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBulgaria\nVivacom Bulgaria EAD\n359-87\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nBulgaria\nMobiltel EAD\n359-88\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nCanada\nBell Mobility Inc.\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nCanada\nRogers Communications Canada Inc.\n1 70579 & 1 51499\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nCanada\nTELUS Communications Inc.\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nChina\nChina Mobile Limited\nPAKMK\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nChina\nChina Mobile Limited\nPAKWA\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nCyprus\nEpic Ltd\n280/10\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nDenmark\nHI3G Denmark ApS (3 Denmark)\n238/06\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1500\nFree\n25\nEgypt\nEtisalat - Misr\n20-11\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nEgypt\nOrange Egypt for Telecommunications\n20-12\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nEgypt\nVodafone Egypt Telecommunications S.A.E\n20-10\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nFrance\nBouygues Télécom\n33-660\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nFrance\nFree Mobile\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\nFree\n25\nFrance\nOrange\n33-689\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1,500\n25\nGambia\nAfricell (Gambia) Limited\n607/02\n70\n70\n70\n300\n1500\nFree\n25\nGermany\nTelefónica Germany GmbH & Co.

    "FullText": "Prepaid   Roaming Tips - Jazz\nHome\nprepaid\nroaming tips\nRoaming\nTips\nEducate yourself and enjoy roaming\nTips for Roamers\nThings to remember on roaming:\nJazz Roaming has never been more simple and affordable. Just a few tips:\nJazz Self-Service channels:\nJazz\nWorld application, WhatsApp self-service support are some of our self-service channels. View the following links:\nJazz Self Service Channels\nJazz World Application\nWhatsApp Self-Service\nWhat if your roaming is not working:\nLets say your roaming was working fine until recently and now it isn’t. Or you got it activated but it isn’t working. Don’t worry. Simply restart your handset, go to settings , find manual operator selection and select any operator from the list available. It should work. If still unsuccessful, email us at\ncustomercare@jazz.com.pk\n. Corporate customers can contact their JBC. We shall take care of it.\nKnow your tariff:\nWe have just made roaming easy for all with $0.2 per min or mb in over 70 major countries. Over 90% of Jazz roamers visit these countries. Still, just make sure you know the roaming rates for the country you plan to visit.\nSay Yes to Data Roaming:\nSince data roaming is also $0.2 per mb in over 70 countries which is much affordable now. We encourage you to use data roaming. Roughly you can make 2-3 minutes of WhatsApp audio call in 1 mb. Not bad, right !\nWhat if Data Roaming is not working\n:\nIf your data roaming is active and you still face issues using it abroad just check:\nYour APN (Access Point Names) settings. Simply configure APN to ‘Jazz’\nSwitch on Data Roaming & Mobile Data from handset settings\nWe shall text you:\nWhile on roaming, you will continue to receive free welcome sms and data usage alerts to help you know your tariff, available offers and avoid any bill shock.\nWatch out for Inflight & maritime:\nNon-terrestrial roaming is expensive. Just make sure your mobile is put on Airplane mode here.\nNo Background Apps:\nSometimes, apps continue running in background without you knowing. So, its better to either turn data roaming on when using it or simply block apps from using data in background (check your mobile data settings).\nSwitch off all free services that you subscribe to. Certain data based applications viz. GPS, Facebook, Twitter, Widgets, RSS Feeds, Email, weather updates, News, Blackberry Messenger or any other instant messaging application etc. as they continuously consume data bandwidth leading to high Data-Roaming charges even when you are not using the same.\nWhy Call forwarding:\nCheck status of your call forwarding to ensure you cancel all call forwards before you travel abroad. So, you may want to review/cancel any call diverts that you may have activated as there will be two-way Roaming charging on Voicemail services and on conditional call forwarding while roaming.\nHow to Activate Now:\nNow that you have gone through these tips, we say it’s a good idea to use roaming and not purchase a local sim from abroad. For postpaid, we have reduced the credit limit requirement for roaming activation which is now Rs. 5000 for postpaid individual customers and Rs. 10,000 for corporate customers. Postpaid individual customers can visit any nearest Jazz business centre, call 777 or email to\ncustomercare@jazz.com.pk\nfor roaming activation. Corporate customers simply need to advise their JBCs (Jazz Business Consultants).\nList of International Direct Dialing Codes\nSr. No\nCountry\nCodes\n1\nAfghanistan\n93\n2\nAlbania\n355\n3\nAlgeria\n213\n4\nAmerican Samoa\n684\n5\nAndorra\n376\n6\nAngola\n244\n7\nAnguilla\n1264\n8\nAntarctica (Casey)\n67212\n9\nAntarctica (Scott & Ross Island)\n67224\n10\nAntigua (Barbuda)\n809\n11\nArab Republic of Egypt\n20\n12\nArgentina\n54\n13\nArmenia\n374\n14\nAruba\n297\n15\nAscension Island\n247\n16\nAustralia\n61\n17\nAustria\n43\n18\nAzerbaijan\n994\n19\nBahamas\n18093\n20\nBahrain\n973\n21\nBangladesh\n880\n22\nBarbados\n1246\n23\nBelarus\n375\n24\nBelgium\n32\n25\nBelize\n501\n26\nBenin\n229\n27\nBermuda\n18092\n28\nBhutan\n975\n29\nBolivia\n591\n30\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n387\n31\nBotswana\n267\n32\nBrazil\n55\n33\nBritish Virgin Islands\n1284\n34\nBrunei\n673\n35\nBulgaria\n359\n36\nBurkina Faso\n226\n37\nBurundi\n257\n38\nCambodia\n855\n39\nCameroon\n237\n40\nCanada\n1\n41\nCape Verde Islands\n238\n42\nCayman Islands\n1345\n43\nCentral African Republic\n236\n44\nChad\n235\n45\nChile\n56\n46\nChristmas & Cocoas Islands\n6724\n47\nColombia\n57\n48\nComoros\n269\n49\nCongo\n242\n50\nCook Islands\n682\n51\nCosta Rica\n506\n52\nCroatia\n385\n53\nCuba\n53\n54\nCyprus\n357\n55\nCzech Republic\n420\n56\nDem Rep of Madagascar\n261\n57\nDem.
