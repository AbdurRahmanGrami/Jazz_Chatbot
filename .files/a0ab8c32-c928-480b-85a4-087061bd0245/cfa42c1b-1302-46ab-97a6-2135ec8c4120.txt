**You:** So if I get an iphone thru jazz and it gets stolen within the 18 months of me paying the installment, it will get replaced for free?
**Bot:** No, if your iPhone purchased through Jazz gets stolen during the 18-month installment period, it will **not** be replaced for free. According to the terms and conditions of the handset insurance included in the upfront cost:

- **Handset insurance covers theft, burglary, screen damage, and water damage.** However, it provides a **claim settlement** for the market value of the phone within the coverage limit, not a replacement.
- You will still be **liable to pay the remaining installments** for the device, even if it is stolen, lost, or damaged beyond repair.

To file a claim for theft, you would need:
1. A police report for theft/robbery/burglary.
2. A picture of the IMEI number of the phone (or pre-registration before the event of the claim).
3. Your CNIC (both sides) and phone purchase invoice.

The claim amount will be transferred to your bank or wallet account upon approval. Let me know if you need further clarification!
