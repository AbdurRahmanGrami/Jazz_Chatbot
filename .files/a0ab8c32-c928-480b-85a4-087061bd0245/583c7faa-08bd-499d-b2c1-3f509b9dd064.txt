**Bot:** If your iPhone purchased through Jazz is stolen during the 18-month installment period, the handset insurance included in the upfront cost provides **claim settlement**, not a free replacement. Here's further clarification:

### **Key Points:**
1. **Claim Settlement**:
   - You will receive compensation for the market value of the phone within the coverage limit, as per the insurance policy.
   - The claim amount is transferred to your bank or wallet account upon approval.

2. **Remaining Installments**:
   - You are still required to pay the remaining installments for the device, even if it is stolen, lost, or damaged beyond repair.

3. **Claim Process**:
   - **Documents Required**:
     - Police report for theft/robbery/burglary.
     - Picture of the IMEI number of the phone (or pre-registration before the event of the claim).
     - CNIC (both sides) and phone purchase invoice.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Submit the required documents to the insurance team.
     - Upon approval, the claim amount is processed.

4. **Coverage Limit**:
   - The insurance policy specifies a maximum coverage limit, which may not fully cover the cost of a new replacement device.
