**Bot:** The maximum monetary compensation provided under Jazz's handset insurance is based on the **market value of the phone** at the time of the claim or the **coverage limit**, whichever is lesser. However, the exact coverage limit is not specified in the available information. 

For accurate details regarding the maximum coverage, I recommend contacting Jazz customer support at **051-8848801** or via WhatsApp at **0326-8120897**. Let me know if you'd like assistance with anything else!
