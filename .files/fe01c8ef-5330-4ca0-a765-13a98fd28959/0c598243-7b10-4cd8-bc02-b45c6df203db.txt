**Bot:** The key differences between **Prepaid BIMA** and **Postpaid BIMA** insurance services offered by Jazz are as follows:

### **1. Payment Method**:
   - **Prepaid BIMA**: The monthly premium is divided into **daily installments** and deducted from the customer's prepaid balance. If the balance is insufficient, coverage is provided proportionally based on the amount paid.
   - **Postpaid BIMA**: The full monthly premium is charged **upfront** and added to the customer's postpaid bill. Coverage begins once the premium is successfully billed.

### **2. Coverage Start**:
   - **Prepaid BIMA**: Coverage begins immediately after the first deduction is made from the prepaid balance.
   - **Postpaid BIMA**: Coverage begins **from the second day** after registration, as the premium is billed in advance.

### **3. Coverage Continuity**:
   - **Prepaid BIMA**: If the customer does not maintain sufficient balance for daily deductions, coverage is **reduced proportionally** based on the amount paid during the month.
   - **Postpaid BIMA**: Coverage is **guaranteed for the entire month** once the premium is billed, regardless of any interruptions in service.
